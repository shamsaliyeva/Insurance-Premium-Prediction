# Insurance Premium Prediction

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between various individual factors—such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region of residence—and medical expenses. A predictive model is developed to estimate the annual medical expenditure for new customers based on these factors. This model will assist medical insurance companies in making data-driven decisions when determining premium rates charged to individuals.
