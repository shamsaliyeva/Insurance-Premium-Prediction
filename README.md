# Insurance Premium Prediction

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between various individual factors (such as age, physical condition, family background, and location) and medical expenses, and to build a predictive model for estimating future medical costs. This model can assist both individuals and medical insurance companies by providing data-driven insights. For individuals, the model offers an estimate of expected medical expenses, helping them make informed decisions when selecting insurance plans. For insurers, the model aids in setting premium rates based on personalized risk profiles.
